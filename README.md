# MC BLACK
An open-source minecraft FPS boosting client
# FEATURES
* FPS boost (too obvious ig)
* net boost
* ip hider+session encrypter (FOR SUSPICIOUS/UNSAFE SERVERS ONLY)
* more to come (cuz this is only the first release)
# HOW IT WORKS
When MC BLACK is downloaded and the zip file is extracted there are 2 custom mods in the requirements folder...
1. MC-BLACK.jar
and
2. MC-BLACK-WEB.jar
here's what they do
MC-BLACK.jar  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
ofcourse the main mod  | Content Cell
Content Cell  |  \| 
The application checks if both the mods have been copied into the mods folder and if minecraft is running or stopped
